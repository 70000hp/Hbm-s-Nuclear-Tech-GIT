## Added
* Antimatter Bomb
  * New Bomb with a unique explosion
  * Requires Hafnium to craft
  * needs 2 lead ion capsules, 2 hafnium ingots, and 1 antimatter cluster to operate

* Hafnium

## Changed
* The radius of the tank explosions, they should no longer kill your world if you have a tank full of antimatter
* Removed some useless, unused junk
* WARNING: FLUID IDS WILL SHIFT.
* Finally Updated to bobs version, you will be fine.

## Fixed
    * The Magnetic Storage Containers now use the `IOverpressurable` interface instead of the legacy `invalidate()` method, this means that your tanks full of anitmatter wont explode when broken by hand.
